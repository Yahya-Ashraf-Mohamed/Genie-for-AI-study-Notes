# Genie-for-AI-Study-Notes

## Introduction
**Genie-for-AI-Study-Notes** is an AI-powered assistant designed to streamline the study process for students. The goal is to help students efficiently manage and understand information from various sources, such as textbooks, PDFs, lecture notes, and online courses.

The AI assistant automatically summarizes complex materials, generates relevant questions, provides answers to specific queries, and highlights areas that need more focus. It optimizes study time, making learning more effective and less overwhelming. Our ultimate vision is to transform how students interact with their study materials, enabling efficient knowledge retention.
